The file contains Project3_V_Rep.py, Readme.tst, Proj 3 output video, remode.dll(64-bit), vrep.py and vrepConst.py.
Project3_V_Rep.py is the actual python code file to be executed along with Vrep.

Instructions on how to run the prgram:

The user has to enter the initial x, y, initial orientation and final x, y in each separate line.
Eg: I have executed the program by putting these coordinates:
Please input x value for initial node -4
Please input y value for initial node -4
Please input value for initial theta in radians 0
Please input x value for goal node -4
Please input y value for goal node 0
Then put y for yes.

At first, it takes time to generate nodes and then when the nodes and the path is generated the simulation starts.

The initial position and orientation is needed to be set manually in the vrep and is to be same as the input given.
