# Project 1

## 8 puzzle problem

Find all the possible states of the 8-Puzzle starting from the given initial state. Note that, the states should be unique (no repetitions).

Use the brute force search algorithm (BFS) to find the path to reach the goal state using the possible states of 8-puzzle. 

You can use Matlab/C++/Python for programing.
